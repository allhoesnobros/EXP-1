Experiment 1 : Introduction to python

Theory :-

In python we can declare multiple data type variables.

for eg. a = 2, b = 4.324 , c = "APPLE" , d = True

We can display data type of the variable by using type() command.

for eg. print(type(a))

In python there are 2 ways to display multiple data in output. By using multiple print command or by declearing variable (such as a,b,c) and using print(a,b,c). We can use print(a,b,c,sep="\n") command to display data stored in variable on new line in output.

Basic mathematical operator are built-in in python such as addition(+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*),division(/),power(**),etc.

To find sum of two integer a and b we can use a+b and to display it in ouput use print("SUM =",a+b). The same can be used for other mathematical operations with there desingnated symbols.

In the above the mathematical operations the value of the integers were pre decleared and if you want to find sum of other integers either you have to copy and paste code and change the integer values or change the value in the current code. Instead of this we can take value from the user and print the required output.

To take input from the user we have to declare the data type of the input and we can also the display what we want from the user (such as "Enter the value of a"). We can take input from user using a=int(input("Enter the value of a :")) and same way take value of b and use command print("SUM =",a+b) to display the sum in the output.

We can take input from the user and use the input value in a formula to find the answer without having to use formula multiple times.

for example : Finding area of circle by taking radius value from the user

r=float(input("Enter radius of circle :")

area = math.pirr (math library is included by using import math command)

print("Area of circle:",area)

if - else statement is used when we want one command to run if the statement is true and if it is false then another command to run.

For example : To check if b is less than or greater than a

if (b<a) : print("b is less than a")

else : print("b is greater than a")

Conclusion :-

This experiment provides a basic understanding of Python syntax, data types, input–output operations, mathematical calculations, and conditional statements, forming a foundation for beginner-level Python programming.
